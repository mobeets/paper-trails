Hello! It's been longer than I thought it would be. Maybe once a week was a little too ambitious, so my new plan is to send out an email every month or so.


__Paper:__ [_The octopus genome and the evolution of cephalopod neural and morphological novelties_](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14668), by Caroline B. Albertin et al. (_Nature_, 2015) [[pdf]](http://sci-hub.tw/10.1038/nature14668).

This week's paper is from 2015, when the octopus genome was first sequenced. It turns out that octopi and squid are something of an anomaly, in that they have the largest "brains" (I'll explain the quotes later) of any all invertebrates. Given how ancient they are, evolutionarily speaking, it was unknown how their brains became so sophisticated while those of other invertebrates did not. By sequencing the octopus genome, we can learn a little more about how this might have happened.

### Haven't we already sequenced all the genomes?

You might have been under the impression that sequencing genomes was sort of a thing of the past. We sequenced the human genome in the 2000s, and surely since then (or so I thought), we've made a pretty good dent in sequencing the genomes of the other species as well.

In fact, __no one has ever sequenced the entire genome of _any_ mammal, including humans.__ (Good article on this [here](https://www.statnews.com/2017/06/20/human-genome-not-fully-sequenced/).) And we've got an even longer way to go with the other species as well.

In the image above, each green line around the circle represents one of the 8 million or so eukaryotic species we've discovered, while the blue and purple are bacteria and archaea. The red lines are the ones we've sequenced. In other words, we've barely even started. Part of this is because sequencing a genome is so expensive, both in terms of finance and computation. __Imagine shredding up five books, and trying to put the pieces back together to form a single book. That's roughly [how we sequence genomes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shotgun_sequencing).__

### Sequencing a genome probably won't make you science-famous

One of my first questions about this paper was (imagine it said in that awful Jerry-Seinfeld-stand-up-routine voice): What's the deal with whole genome sequencing? Do you really just have to pick a random animal, sequence its genome, and then you get to publish an article in _Science_ or _Nature_?

Well, there are are a handful of projects that aim to sequence the genome of every single living species. The [Genome 10k](https://genome10k.soe.ucsc.edu/) project, for example, aims to sequence 10,000 vertebrate genomes (one from each genus). Taking a look at their [publication list](https://genome10k.soe.ucsc.edu/publications), however, it's clearly not true that merely sequencing a sunfish, for example, is enough to get you a paper in a high-profile journal.

Instead, I think what earns you a high-profile publication is using the sequence to learn something about those species whose development appears somewhat out of the ordinary. For example, [sequencing the seahorse genome](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature20595) to understand why in seahorses, the males get pregnant, whereas in other species it's the females. In this paper's case, __the out of the ordinary part about octopi and squid is, roughly speaking, the fact that they have complicated brains at all.__

### Molluscs and cephalopods

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/public/images/week5/octopus.png" style="width: 100%; min-width: 250px; float: left; margin-top: 20px; margin-right: 10px;">

So this paper is about the genetic sequence of a single male California two-spot octopus (the cartoon above is from the paper), but the authors see their results as applying more generally to so-called ["coleoid cephalopods,"](https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/258669) a sub-class of species that includes octopi, squid, and cuttlefish.

Octopi, squid, and cuttlefish are all part of the mollusc phylum, which includes other, much dumber species such as clams, oysters, snails, and slugs. Molluscs are very common, making up about 25% of all known underwater species. (Most molluscs, it turns out, are just snails. Apparently, malacologists--or, "mollusc scientists," if you'd prefer--really enjoy identifying new species of snails.)

The fact that octopi and squid are molluscs tells us two very key things: First, because they don't have torsos, __their testes and anus are in their heads.__ (The gonads are colored peach in the cartoon above.) And finally, like all molluscs with brains, __their brains are wrapped around their esophagus,__ which means if they eat something too large they can get brain damage. (The two "brains," or central ganglia, are in hot pink and light pink in the cartoon above.)

But coleoid cephalopods such as octopi, squid, and cuttlefish--unlike most molluscs--don't have a shell, which means they can [signal via their skin](http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/320/1200/437.short) either for camouflage, hunting, or mating. They also have arms (and tentacles; as Wikipedia puts it, "Squid have spectacular tentacles"), swim via jet propulsion, and have complex sensory systems. All of this enables these impressive behaviors:

- [using coconuts as tools](https://youtu.be/BFda1MZ54G4?t=34s)
- [disguising themselves](https://youtu.be/pgDE2DOICuc) as harmless fish or plants
- [opening jars](https://youtu.be/ocWF6d0nelY)
- [learning mazes](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10339-007-0192-9)

Obviously, cats can do amazing things too (open boxes, hide in boxes, etc.), but this is maybe less surprising because cats, like all vertebrates, have a central nervous system. So how is it that cephalopod behavior is so complex?

<!-- Within the mollusc phylum, we have the cephalopods. Cephalopods, of which there are roughly 700 known species, are then subdivided even further based on how many arms and tentacles they have. (As Wikipedia puts it, "Squid have spectacular tentacles.") Coleoids have either 8 or 10 appendages. Unlike most molluscs, coleoid cephalopods don't have a shell, which means they can signal via their skin either for camouflage, hunting, or mating. -->

### Complex behavior requires complex neural circuitry

One of the key ways that _vertebrates_ evolved new traits so rapidly was through [whole genome duplication](http://dev.biologists.org/content/1994/Supplement/125.short). So before this current paper, the theory was that a similar thing must have happened for cephalopods. However, in this paper, the authors report _no_ evidence for genome duplication in the octopus genome. Instead, they find a variety of explanations, including the expansion of existing gene families, and development in how and where those genes are expressed.

Invertebrates, which make up a majority of all known animal species (in the ballpark of 98%), are not known for their sophisticated nervous systems. Vertebrates, on the other hand, are known for having a centralized brain, and much more complex behaviors as a result. However, it's not the brain _per se_ that leads to more complex behaviors. The thinking is that to evolve complex behaviors you need _speed_. And most invertebrates are very slow.

The ability to move quickly comes down to the presence of speedy connections between neurons. If you think about what happens when a gazelle sees a tiger, for example, the gazelle's retinal neurons need to quickly transmit information from the eye to the relevant part of the gazelle's brain in order to trigger an escape response. One critical thing that vertebrates have that enables these quick responses is _myelin_, a conductive coating on neurons that enables neurons to transmit signals much faster.

Most invertebrates, including cephalopods, don't have myelin. Cephalopods do have [thicker axons](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982208004491), which helps a bit, but these thicker axons are often limited to the neurons involved in their rapid escape response.

But by examining the genome, the authors found a clue: An increased expansion in a particular gene family that encode molecules known as "protocadherins." [Protocadherins](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21029858) are thought to help the formation of local networks of neurons in the brain. And it turns out that cephalopod nervous systems show a lot of complexity in their local networks but not so much larger networks. This is likely because long-term networks would involve myelin, which isn't an option here. So, the authors conclude (emphasis mine):

<p style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%;">"The expression of protocadherins in octopus neural tissues is consistent with a central role for these genes in establishing and maintaining cephalopod nervous system organization <b>as they do in vertebrates</b>."</p>

This expansion in the protocadherin gene family appears to be an example of [convergent evolution](http://www.zo.utexas.edu/courses/thoc/convergence.html), because it evolved in cephalopods _independently_ of it evolving in vertebrates. In this case, having more genes for protocadherins may have provided for the development of more complex neural circuitry, which in turn would enable the sophisticated behaviors we see in cephalopods.

<!-- - Familiar cephalopods include coleoids:squid, cut- tlefish, octopus
- At present at least 700 spe- cies of living cephalopods
- coleoids can be grouped into two, based on having either 8 or 10 appendages
	- nautilus has 90 appendages (it's not a coleoid)
- modification of the foot into arms and tentacles
- use a heavily modified mantle appendage, the funnel, to swim via jet-propulsion. This mode of loco- motion, and the morphological and physiological adap- tations it entailed, played a substantial role in the evolu- tion of this lineage as a whole 
- utilize specialized skin cells (chromatophores, iridophores, leucophores and papillae) to effect visual and textural camouflage
- Cole- oids will release an opaque cloud of melanin to obscure their path of retreat when threatened. -->

From summary: http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/08/octopus-genome-surprises-and-teases
- almost as many base pairs as humans, but actually more protein-coding genes
- no evidence for "whole genome duplication," which could be a mechanism for evolving new traits
- instead, growth in genome was concentrated in two gene families
	- these gene families are associated with neural development
	- also noted the "introduction of repetitive sequences, and sweeping genomic rearrangements"
- octopus‚Äôs neural system lacks myelin and thus evolved a different strategy that relies on local neural communication
- "Just which genes are responsible for the various octopus traits remains to be unraveled"

Brains:

- brain of Octopus vulgarus (fig. 2B) is perhaps the most elaborate, with approximately 40 lobes
- "like all molluscs, the brain sur- rounds the esophagus"
	- this means if they eat something too large, they can get brain damage
- "malacologists"
- "Shell loss is presumed to parallel development of advanced chromatophore/crypsis abilities"
- octopi can be taught to navigate a maze and then do it correctly a month later
- Here we posit that the antecedents of neural and behavioral com- plexity in cephalopods might pre-date the ‚Äòcognitive ra- diation‚Äô [Packard, 1972; Aronson, 1991] at the time bony fish appeared in the seas. Cephalopods had many other competing species to contend with prior to bony fishes,...
- no myelination, but thicker axons (both affect conduction velocity), and maybe more reliance on local networks than long-range connectivity
	- https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982208004491

Sensory abilities:

- Coleoid eyes are a textbook example of convergent evolution, bearing many resemblances to vertebrate eyes, including a crystalline lens
- extensively using arms and tentacles for touch-taste sensory reception
- rely on paired olfactory rhinophores to detect chemical information at a distance
- "Nautiluses are thought to be specialized for a ‚Äòsmelling and groping‚Äô lifestyle" -->
