Something a little different this week: Politics and economics instead of biology and neuroscience. Most of the work I'm talking about is from the 1950's, but it still relates to the present-day--at least from a historical perspective--so I think they're ideas worth thinking about.

### The impossibility* of choosing among three candidates

With the midterms having just past, voting has been more on my mind than usual. Clearly things right now are very polarized, politically, and so the question might have occurred to you as it has to me: Would things be better off if there were three parties instead of just two?

In fact, in 1950, the economist Kenneth Arrow introduced what's known as [_Arrow's Impossibility Theorem_](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/256963?journalCode=jpe), which suggests that having three options might only make things more complicated: When voters have three or more options to choose between, it is in fact _impossible_ to aggregate voters' preferences into a community-wide decision as to who should be elected (given a few assumptions about what it means for a decision to be fair to everyone).

As you might imagine, Arrow's Impossibility Theorem generated a lot of controversy when it was first published. (As with all theorems, the proof requires a few assumptions that are themselves up for debate.) But in general, the problem comes down to the fact that when you have three or more options, there can always be cycles, which prevents you from choosing a winner. This was first written about in 1785 by the French mathematician Condorcet.

As an example of a voting cycle, imagine that Beyonce somehow jumped into the Texas senate race at the last minute, alongside Beto and Ted Cruz. Then it's possible that the majority of people would prefer Beto to Beyonce, and the majority would prefer Beyonce to Cruz, but it's also possible that more people prefer Cruz to Beto, causing a neverending loop!

(On a related note, [fairness](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05807) is impossible too. Then again, ``100\% sterile is also impossible but that doesn't mean you don't wash your hands before surgery.'')

### How can we agree on a collective decision?

Arrow's Impossibility Theorem is part of a field called [_public choice_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_choice), which lies at the intersection of economics and politics. The goal of public choice is, roughly, to analyze how multiple people, each with their own distinct wants/needs/economics, can come to an agreement on an issue and form a collective decision. As you can imagine, this theory impacts everything from local PTA meetings to the decision of who to elect to government.

The problem is, building a mathematical theory requires assumptions, and the way politics works is always in flux. So to be pessimistic, these theories are doomed to never be useful in practice. However, by being explicit about assumptions, and seeing how even simple assumptions can lead to very nonintuitive solutions, there's a lot to learn about what is fair, and what is possible.

### Pareto efficiency

In the 1950's, Arrow's impossibility theorem, along with other popular work such as the liberal paradox and the median voter theorem, eventually found application to welfare economics, and the field of _social_ choice. Roughly: Can we make economic decisions that consider the community's well-being?

At the heart of social choice theory is the idea of Pareto efficiency, something that comes up a lot in economics. But Pareto efficiency can also be applied to a lot of things outside of economics too--for example, it can explain why some of the best basketball players are not necessarily just the ones leading the league in offense or defense stats.

If something is Pareto efficient, it means that you can't improve one aspect of it without making another part worse. Let's say you, me, and one other friend are trying to divide up a pie. Then any pie-dividing strategy that leaves no pie behind is called Pareto efficient. So for example, if _I_ eat all of the pie, that's Pareto efficient. It's not necessarily _fair_, but it is Pareto efficient. The idea of _market_ efficiency means that the market will convert any solution that is _not_ Pareto efficient into one that is. So for example, if we slice the pie into quarters, and then each of us get a slice, that would leave a quarter of the pie behind, which is Pareto inefficient. Market efficiency says that one of us is going to eat that last piece.

The key idea in welfare economics is that maybe we can use a similar idea to handle inequalities in wealth across a population. The assumption here is that the current state of the world, in which a small amount of people have most of the money, and most people have very little, is Pareto efficient. But it's not the only Pareto efficient outcome! If the federal government injects a lot of money into the economy, this will perturb the system away from its current position. If the market is truly efficient, then it will correct itself from the perturbation and end up at a _new_ Pareto efficient solution. Hopefully, a situation where the distribution of wealth is more uniform.

So the story goes at least. One of the usual premises in welfare economics is that it's possible to rank every socioeconomic position in order from least desirable to most desirable.

### Choosing a policy

Another classic theorem in public choice is the [_median voter theorem_](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/256633?journalCode=jpe). For simplicity, imagine we can describe everyone's political position along a single axis. (This is basically what we're doing when we describe someone's political position as being somewhere in between liberal, moderate, or conservative.) If you look across the population, there will be some distribution of this political sentiment, which we can imagine for now is shaped like a bell curve.

Now imagine that there's an election with two candidates, each with their own position somewhere along this axis. A typical assumption is that voters vote for whichever candidate's position is closest to theirs. Given the distribution of voter's preferences, which candidate will win the election?

If the election is determined by a simple majority, it's easy to see that whichever candidate's policy is closest to the median of the distribution will be the winner. Because of this, if a candidate wants to choose their policy in order to win an election against another candidate, they are best off* choosing a policy nearest that of the so-called `median voter'. (A famous quote from this time says that ``parties formulate policies in order to win elections, rather than win elections in order to formulate policies.'')

Despite the fact that this model is likely incomplete, the idea of the median voter is still very prevalent in the way we think about elections. It explains why candidates are described as `moving towards the center' as their campaign continues and they learn more about the electorate. It's also an explanation of why candidates often have far more extreme policies (either liberal or conservative) during primaries than they do during general elections: The ``median voter'' in a primary will be different than the median voter in the general election, and so it's more optimal in this sense for candidates to have different policies when the electorate is different.

### Multi-dimensional policy space

As with Arrow's impossibility theorem, the assumptions of the median voter theorem [may not apply in practice](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S017626801000073X). For example, above we assumed that there is only a single axis describing everyone's political position, when in reality it's likely the policy space is likely multi-dimensional.

In a multi-dimensional policy space, instead of there being a single axis/dimension describing every voter's preferences, we can think of there being one dimension per political issue. For example, two such dimensions might describe where every voter stands on the issues of "immigration" and "government spending".

One key assumption made above is that voters have fixed policy positions, and that the candidates are the ones optimizing their positions so as to become elected. In practice, candidates cannot move their positions around _too_ much, or else they'd be called out for `flip-flopping'. This keeps them [relatively immobile](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=lXY6AAAAIAAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PR11#v=onepage&q&f=false) in policy space.

But clearly, as we saw in the 2016 presidential election, voters' positions are not only in flux--they are also open to manipulation. And this opens up a whole new realm of possibilities for candidates. Perhaps a more efficient way of guaranteeing election is, instead of changing your _policy_, maybe you can just change your _voters_.

<!-- "Norms volve, culture is critical, and strategic actors can shift the understanding of a situation. So it is by no means self-evident that participants are playing the same game that analysts think they are playing, especially where analysts rely on the written rules to understand the game." -->

We could imagine modeling this by updating our assumption about how voters work. For example, in a more realistic model, maybe voters don't just passively vote for the candidate nearest to them in policy space. Instead, their positions themselves may be either attracted or repelled by candidates' positions. This will change the distribution of voters in policy space, which will in turn change which candidate is likely to win. In this view, a candidate doesn't have to change his policy to match the median voter--he can also change the median voter to match his policy.

As Bryan Jones wrote in his book [_Reconceiving Decision-Making in Democratic Politics_](https://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/R/bo3635462.html), maybe we should re-think this idea of voters existing in a policy space, with relatively fixed preferences. As he suggests, "any theory of democratic decision-making must be more about information processing and less about preference maximization."

This emphasis on information seems especially relevant to thinking about voter manipulation. While we may make voting decisions that are optimal given the information we have at any given point in time, the thing that is _constantly_ changing is our attention. If we make decisions based on the issues that we are currently paying attention to, then controlling what people pay attention to is an essential ingredient in influencing how people vote. The Internet is all about controlling attention. And unfortunately, it seems unlikely that any degree of legislation or general watchfulness on the part of social media companies is going to change that.

Hopefully more work in public choice will explore what is likely to happen when candidates, instead of just choosing their policy, are also able to influence/manipulate the electorate itself.
