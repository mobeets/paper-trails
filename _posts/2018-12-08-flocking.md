__Paper:__ [_Scale-free correlations in starling flocks_](http://www.pnas.org/content/107/26/11865), by Andrea Cavagna et al. (_PNAS_, 2010).

__Interactive__: [Boids and Bugs](https://mobeets.github.io/boids-and-bugs/) (by me)

Many areas of science aim to understand how complexity can arise from simple rules. But flocks of starlings might be one of the most striking examples of just how wide the gap between simplicity of rules and complexity of the resulting behavior can be.

Of course, starlings aren't the only species that shows collective group behavior. There's also:

- flocking in birds
- schooling in fish
- herding in cattle and other mammals
- swarming in insects (and bacteria)

One of the most interesting aspects of collective behavior is how new abilities emerge at the group level that are not present in any individual. (More on this later.) Understanding how such a thing is even possible has attracted scientists from a wide range of backgrounds, including biology, physics, robotics, and mathematics. This week's paper is a perfect example of how all those subjects fit together.

## Boids

One of the first big steps towards understanding flocking came in 1986, when a computer animator named Craig Reynolds* made a computer program to simulate bird flight, which he called [Boids](https://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/). This model of flocking involved three basic rules:

1. __separation/repulsion__: avoid collisions
2. __cohesion__: stay close to your neighbors
3. __alignment__: move in the same direction as your neighbors

(*The Boids program was used in Tim Burton's _Batman Returns_ to simulate bat swarms, and Craig Reynolds later won an Academy Award for his pioneering work using computer animation in films.)

How do these three rules interact to create such a complex result? It's easiest to think about what might happen if we had a system with none of these rules, and then we can see what happens when we add each rule in turn.

<div style="clear:both;"></div>
- __No rules:__ You can think of a gas as a collection of particles that obeys none of the Boids rules. The result is random, incoherent motion.
- __Rule 1:__ If you give your particles the first rule above--a sense of personal space--they start to act like flies. Each fly goes basically wherever it wants, but it has the decency to avoid collisions.
- __Rules 1+2:__ Next, give your flies cohesion, or a desire to stay close to the pack, and you have a swarm.
- __Rules 1+2+3:__ Finally, when the bugs in your swarm try to align themselves with their neighbors, so that everyone's flying in the same direction, that's when things start to look like a flock.

__Play around with these rules yourself with [Boids and Bugs](https://mobeets.github.io/boids-and-bugs/)__, an app I made which builds off of the original Boids. (You can also use your cursor as a predator to try herding the little particles.)

## Why flock?

Boids is a simple model of how collective behavior can emerge from simple rules. But is it really how things work in the wild? What makes this topic especially interesting to me is that it's only in the last ten years or so that we've had the technology to collect sufficiently detailed data from actual bird flocks. In this week's paper, the authors used multiple cameras set up on the top of the national museum in Rome, and used [3D tracking](https://www.isc.cnr.it/research/topics/physical-biology/biological-systems/starflag-a-project-on-collective-animal-behaviour/) to capture the flight trajectories of individual birds in a flock of thousands.

Most people believe starlings form flocks for protection against predators. How does flocking offer protection? If a hawk swoops towards part of the group, it's likely that only the starlings closest to the hawk will actually see it and try to escape. But the _alignment_ rule above will enable the group to react as a unit. __If all of the starlings are strongly aligned with each other, the flock will be able to turn away as one, despite the fact that most starlings won't have even seen the hawk.__

So in this paper, the authors' goal was to determine to what extent the motion of a given bird's flight influences the flight of the other birds. This can be measured by assessing how strongly their direction of motion is correlated.

Critically, in a very large flock, if two starlings are far enough away they have no way of directly perceiving one another, and so no way of aligning their flight. But if each bird is aligning itself with all of its immediate neighbors, then the two more distant birds can still be correlated, because the birds' movements can be shared throughout the group.

## Starlings playing Telephone

As the authors explain, alignment in flocks is like playing a game of Telephone, in which each person passes a message only to the neighbor immediately next to them. To allow the message to make it to everyone in the group, you need each message to be passed without too much noise, or error.

Of course, the more people you have playing Telephone, the less likely your message will make it around the circle without being corrupted. Similarly, the larger the flock of starlings, the less likely it might seem that information about a predator could make it to birds on the other side of the group.

Surprisingly, the authors found that information _can_ in fact travel to all the starlings in a flock. The authors observed correlations in starling flocks that were roughly 'scale-free,' meaning that __starlings' directions were correlated throughout the flock _regardless of how large the flocks were_.__ This is evidence that flocks of starlings can effectively act as a cohesive whole, able to respond to perturbations (such as hawks) in a way that no individual bird could achieve alone.

## Self-organized criticality

You might be wondering why so many physicists and mathematicians are interested in understanding how a bunch of birds fly in groups. The reason is that flocks of starlings appear to have an interesting mathematical property that is also found in many other complex natural systems.

As you know, when you heat water past a certain temperature, it undergoes what's called a phase transition as it turns into water vapor. When the temperature gets near that transition, at around 100ยบ C, it's said to be at a 'critical' point. Many other systems have critical points as well. For example, snowy mountains are at a critical point right before they avalanche, and the same is thought to be true of earthquakes. Some even argue that the brain may be situated at a critical point [''between dead and epileptic.''](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10955-011-0229-4)

One [appealing, but unproven theory](https://journals.aps.org/rmp/abstract/10.1103/RevModPhys.90.031001) is that biological systems might have evolved to operate near criticality. The reason is that, near criticality, systems can achieve a unique balance: not so sensitive that the slightest perturbation causes chaos (as in an earthquake, or epilepsy), but not so robust that they're unresponsive (like a mountain, or a dead brain).

__Scale-free correlations, as observed in this week's paper, are a trademark of systems near criticality.__ While it is not known for certain whether starling flocks are truly operating near a critical point, [other work](https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/03/12/1118633109.short) has found additional theoretical support of the idea.
