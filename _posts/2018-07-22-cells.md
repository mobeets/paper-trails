### Why is a cell alive?

What makes something _alive_? As you might have been taught through sheer repetition in grade school: _The cell is the fundamental unit of life._ In other words, by definition, all living things are made of cells. This is the reason things like yeast and plants are alive but rocks and oxygen are not.

The problem is, a cell is just an arbitrary collection of proteins and nucleic acids, which are themselves arbitrary collections of carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen, which are themselves arbitrary collections of protons and electrons, and so on. So in a way, saying that something is alive if it is made of cells is sort of a cop-out. After all, "cells" is the answer to a lot of other questions as well. (What is blood made of? Cells that can carry around oxygen. What is your brain made of? Cells that communicate via electricity. And so on.)

There's an awfully large gap between a single cell and a zebra, say. So how is it that a cell, a little self-sufficient entity made of DNA/RNA and proteins, can be an entire organism in itself (such as bacteria), but also the building block of all complex life such as insects and animals? __How did life bridge the gap, evolving single-celled organisms into complex multicellular organisms?__

### The evolution of multicellular organisms

Over the course of Earth's biological history, __multicellular life has evolved from unicellular life [at least 25 different times](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.36.102403.114735).__ Why did this happen? Under certain conditions, there must be a survival advantage given to cells that start to group up and specialize in different behaviors. For example, multicellular organisms tend to be larger, which probably make it less likely to be eaten.

But despite its apparent prevalance, the evolution of multicellularity has been somewhat tricky to explain. For a single-celled organism to become multicellular, it needs to develop cell-cell adhesion (so it doesn't fall apart), cell-cell communication and division of labor (e.g., one cell might do the swimming while the other takes in oxygen), among other things. Each of these steps requires a coordination among cells that can be all too easily exploited by a rogue cell hoping to catch a free ride. The challenge, from an evolutionary standpoint, is to explain how the benefits of participating in a multicellular organism could outweigh the benefits of exploiting the collective. Otherwise, there might always be a small benefit to remaining unicellular.

<!-- Disadvantages:

- Single cells can exploit the advantage of being in a group; "cooperation invites cheating"
- Take two cells of different species. They must somehow reproduce in a way that results in an organisms with the fusion of their respective DNA

Advantages:

- larger size (e.g., less predation)
- specialization, division of labor -->

"Over the history of life, multicellularity has evolved repeatedly in unrelated phylogenetic groups. The potential for the evolution of multicellularity may be less constrained than is frequently postulated." -->

### Artificially evolving multicellularity

In this week's paper, the authors examine how __they were able to artificially evolve a single-celled yeast species into a multicellular one.__

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/public/images/week7/snowflake.png" style="width: 25%; min-width: 200px; float: left; margin-top: 20px; margin-right: 10px;">

The authors first presented this result in their [2011 paper](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/01/10/1115323109.short). The idea is simple, and pretty clever: Grow some unicellular yeast _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_ in a liquid medium, shake it up, and transfer these cells to a new medium. The cells will gradually settle due to gravity, with the heavier cells settling first. The authors then create an "artificial" (i.e., experimenter-controlled) selection pressure*, by keeping only the lower 10% of the medium and throwing the rest out. Now, repeat! In this world, an "adaptive" cell is one that sinks to the bottom quickly. __If the yeast cells could somehow become multicellular, they would sink more quickly, and be more likely to survive another generation.__

And in fact, after up to 60 transfers (one per day), the medium was "dominated by roughly spherical snowflake-like phenotypes consisting of multiple attached cells." They repeated this experiment with 10 different starting sets of yeast, and ended up with this same result every time. __In one population, they found multicellular yeast after only 7 days.__

(* [More recently](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/06/07/247361), the authors were able to evolve multicellularity in a more natural setting: predation. They took a single-celled algae called _Chlamydomonas_ and exposed it to a population of paramecia that tend to eat smaller cells. Within a year or so, two of the five populations developed multicellular structures.)

### Snowflake yeast

The authors find that the resulting multicellular clusters, which they call "snowflake yeast," were formed by "post-division adhesion." This means that __every time a cell divided into two, the daughter yeast cell remained attached to its mother,__ physically and probably also financially. Then the two cells divided again, and these daughter cells remained attached as well, over and over again until you have a big family tree of yeast. This evolved multicellularity appeared to be stable, because the yeast remained multicellular even when the experimenters stopped selecting for sunken cells.

The critical questions addressed by the newer [2015 paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms7102) are the following: What mutations or genes enabled these snowflake yeast to become multicellular? And how were the yeast able to starting evolving as a multicellular organism, as opposed to only showing changes at the level of individual cells?

<!-- They found that around a thousand genes were expressed significantly differently, but of the 10 most downregulated genes, seven of them were related to daughter cell separation.  -->
The authors first compared the gene expression between the unicellular yeast and the evolved multicellular yeast. This led them to identify a single gene related to daughter cell separation that was being downregulated in the multicellular yeast, and they validated this finding by directly mutating the gene and showing it could make the yeast either cluster or not. __So it turns out that the disruption of only a single gene was enough to make the unicellular yeast become multicellular.__

In some ways, this might seem a little disappointing: The authors are claiming to have created a "multicellular" organism only because they've indirectly altered the gene that tells daughter cells to separate following cell division. But that's not all that happens...

### A family-tree made of yeast who never leave their parents

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/public/images/week7/doubling.png" style="width: 25%; min-width: 400px; float: left; margin-top: 20px; margin-right: 10px;">

This simple mutation that causes new cells to remain attached ends up having a huge macro effect on the snowflake yeast's structure. When a cell divides (purple cell in the diagram), the daughter cell (blue cell at time 1) remains connected to it. Later on, when the daughter cell divides, the grand-daughter cell (green cell at time 2) will be connected to the daughter but not to the grandmother. Now suppose you wanted to know: How many grandchildren cells will there be after 10 years? How many great-great-great grandchildren? The authors show that the answer is described by Pascal's triangle, and that this simple model (with a few alterations, because cells don't divide synchronously) predicts the structure of their snowflake yeast. This means we really can think about the snowflake yeast structure as being a family tree made of yeast cells.

This family tree structure ends up giving these snowflake yeast an easy way to reproduce: __When a single cell dies, every cell descended from that cell will lose its connection to the main tree, resulting in a new independent cluster.__ The authors showed in their 2011 paper that _apoptosis_, or programmed cell death, co-evolved along with multicellularity under their selection conditions, allowing the yeast to separate when it was beneficial to do so. Apoptosis in this case is a form of division of labor (or cellular nationalism?), because no single cell in its right mind would ordinarily choose to die for its cluster unless it was for a really good reason.

Even more important, __the family tree structure enables mutations to affect the entire cluster as opposed to just a single cell.__ Let's say somewhere in the family tree, a mutation occurs in one of the cells. Let's call this cell Aunt Edna. Over time, every cell descended from Aunt Edna will likely also inherit her mutation. When Aunt Edna dies, her descendents will break off, comprising a new snowflake cluster all made of cells with the same mutation. To support this claim, the authors do a bit of modeling to show that in the long run, the snowflake yeast structure does indeed imply that clusters will eventually be composed of genetically identical cells.

### Conclusion

The authors have shown that their multicellular snowflake yeast can effectively evolve as a unit, not merely as a collection of single cells. As they put it, these experiments "demonstrate that a single genetic change [can] create a new level of biological organization." This simple genetic change caused:

- cells to cluster, becoming multicellular
- cells to have programmed cell death, allowing the cluster to effectively reproduce
- cells to be structured in such a way that allows mutations to affect the entire cluster

This highlights the fact that __genes that have one effect in a single-celled organism may have a completely different effect in a multicellular one.__ This is in line with [recent work](https://elifesciences.org/articles/34226) published just a few months ago that found that a lot of the genes we once thought to be unique to animals are also present in simple unicellular organisms called choanoflagellates. This suggests that the evolution of multicellularity may not require as many genetic changes as we might think.

### Complex multicellularity

How did all the complex genetic machinery of multicellular organisms come to be? Did multicellularity require a major leap, or is there a simpler way of ending up with all the complex features of multicellular organisms?

Recent work, including [this paper](https://elifesciences.org/articles/34226) published just a few months ago, has found that a lot of the genes we once thought to be unique to animals are also present in simple unicellular organisms called choanoflagellates. What this suggests is that genes that have one effect in a single-celled organism may have a completely different effect in a multicellular one. [For example](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/06/momentous-transition-multicellular-life-may-not-have-been-so-hard-after-all), "choanoflagellates have genes for proteins crucial to neurons, and yet their cells don't resemble nerve cells." The idea is that, "if choanoflagellates offer a glimpse of the one-celled ancestor of animals, that organism was already well-equipped for multicellular life." -->

<!-- Paper finding that genes previously thought to be unique to animals are actually present in a single cell. These genes likely serve some purpose in a single cell, but once they become part of a multi-celled thing, they have some other purpose. -->

<!-- ### Complex multicellularity

As I mentioned earlier, simple multicellular organisms have evolved multiple times. But _complex_ multicellular organisms--those that show cell-to-cell communication, tissue specialization, and three-dimensional structure--are less common. In fact, complex multicellular organisms belong to only six different clades: animals, plants, red algae, brown algae, and two groups of fungi.

There appears to be a common path for this complexity: First, simple mutations to genes lead to cells sticking together rather than separating. Next, channels between cells allowing for cell-to-cell transfer of nutrients and signalling molecules. Finally, a division of labor that leads to cells grouping up into specialized tissues and organs.

- "complex multicellularity, as defined here, occurs only in the Eukarya...A fundamental feature of eukaryotes is the dynamic cytoskeletal and membrane system that governs morphological patterning in cells."
- "Thus, two processes critical to the development of complex multicellular organisms—cell differentiation and programmed cell death—originated in unicellular eukaryotes early in the evolutionary history of the domain." -->

### Summary

- _Topic_: The evolution of multicellular organisms
- _The ultimate goal_: Understanding how life evolved from single-celled organisms into single organisms made of trillions of cells working in concert
- _Conclusion_: Much of the complexity of multicellularity organisms may arise from simple modifications of genes already present in the unicellular ancestor
