__Paper:__ [_Plant behaviour and communication_](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2008.01183.x), by Richard Karban (_Ecology Letters_, 2008) [[pdf]](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2008.01183.x).

__Soundtrack:__ [_Journey Through The Secret Life of Plants_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCjqWSWOuiY&index=2&list=PLSQMOy2KqI7cjxEfSXaYJpCKnU0Ixn4WN), Stevie Wonder's soundtrack to a [documentary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secret_Life_of_Plants)

The last few weeks I've been thinking a lot about claims of "plant intelligence" and "plant communication." I dug through more than ten different scientific papers, read about L. Ron Hubbard and his [screaming tomatoes](https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2012/06/16/meet-your-vegetables/K9Q57mh3vuj5P2RvV6rUuK/story.html), and watched M. Night Shayamalan's surprisingly entertaining movie (in a _Troll 2_ kind of way) about human-killing plant toxins called [_The Happening_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0949731/).

Clearly, plants are dumb, so the idea that they could be intelligent might sound like scientific click-bait. (And a lot of the time, it is.) On the other hand, plants really do have a lot of abilities that are pretty impressive, and so maybe calling it "plant intelligence" is just a way of inspiring new ways of thinking about how different types of intelligence might have evolved.

Overall, the tldr for this week is this: __Whether or not plants are _intelligent_ in an absolute sense, they are at least _more_ intelligent than most people think. But that doesn't mean you can pretend they're Pixar characters.__

### Plants don't care about music

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/public/images/week6/tomato.jpg" style="width: 25%; min-width: 200px; float: left; margin-top: 20px; margin-right: 10px;">

Most discussions of plant intelligence start with the old wives' tale that singing to your plants will help them grow, and that they might prefer Mozart to Metallica. This sort of mystical way of thinking about plants was popularized by the 1973 book [_The Secret Life of Plants_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secret_Life_of_Plants), a book whose pseudoscience made it difficult for decades of biologists to claim any parallels between plants and humans without [fear of being shunned](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/12/23/the-intelligent-plant).

<!-- After the next sentence might be a good place to list a ton of interesting plant behaviors. This could even be a whole section. -->

<!-- However, just because plants don't have emotions or consciousness doesn't mean there isn't a definition of "intelligence" that might be useful scientifically. As plant biologist Anthony Trewavas [put it](https://academic.oup.com/aob/article/93/4/353/197093): "Different concepts and imaginative approaches are used in science because they suggest new experiments, new conceptual approaches and throw new light on complex problems." -->

But now the dust has settled, and many botanists are looking for more useful ways of thinking about plant intelligence. For starters: How should we define intelligence? 30-40 years ago, intelligence was something only humans had. Now, we might be more cerebrocentric and think that intelligence at least requires a brain. As I mentioned in last month's email, one primary benefit of having a brain is that it permits fast movement. But plants are _sessile_ (meaning they don't move), so movement is clearly not a top priority* for plants, and so a brain might not serve much of a purpose. Instead, as plant biologist Anthony Trewavas suggests, __maybe we should think of movement in animals as parallel to growth and development in plants.__

_\* Unless you're a venus fly trap, or a [Mimosa pudica](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLTcVNyOhUc). In fact, though plants don't have a brain, they do appear to also [communicate electrically](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-3040.2006.01614.x) via action potentials._

While you can argue [back](https://academic.oup.com/aob/article/92/1/1/177536) - [and](https://academic.oup.com/aob/article/93/4/345/197057) - [forth](https://academic.oup.com/aob/article/93/4/353/197093) about whether defining intelligence for plants is even useful, the perspective many botanists have settled upon is [this](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1360138515002897):

<!-- The definition that many botanists seem to have settled upon is the more no-nonsense perspective of [this review](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1360138515002897) on intelligent plant behavior: -->

<!-- Or, you can take this not-a-big-deal perspective of [this review](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1360138515002897) on intelligent plant behavior:
 -->
<blockquote>Definitions of `behavior' and `intelligence' vary. Intuitively we think of these terms as referring exclusively to humans, but essentially they describe the ability of organisms to respond to environmental challenges in such a way as to optimize fitness. Plants have similar properties.</blockquote>

<!-- Internal communication in plants:

- "The nature of the internal communication of plants is primarily through low-molecular-weight chemical compounds, not unlike neurotransmitters in animals, as well as by the release of Ca2+ ions from inter- and intracellular stores"
- "Electrical activity is likewise evident in plants" [44]
	- "When a single leaf on a plant is wounded, this experience is shared within seconds with the rest of the plant [42,45]"
- https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-3040.2006.01614.x
	- "Burdon‐Sanderson (1873) was the first to discover APs in plants following stimulation of a Dionaea leaf"
	- "In 1930, APs were recorded with inserted microelectrodes in Nitella cells (Umrath 1930), earlier than the first intracellular recording of an AP in animal cells (Nastuk & Hodgkin 1950; Tasaki 1952)."
		- "The reason why plants have developed pathways for electrical signal transmission is most probably the necessity to respond rapidly to external stimuli, for example, environmental stress factors."
	- like in Mimosa pudica (as in Costa Rica!), "folding of leaflets is associated with the transmission of an AP"
	- one of the uses of APs: "In Dionaea, catching starts with the release of calcium into the cytosol of the sensor cells (Hodick & Sievers 1988), induced by mechanical pressure of one of the trigger hairs. Subsequently, an AP is generated without any response of the trap. If any of the trigger hairs is bent no later than 40 s after the first, a second fast AP (20 cm s−1) is evoked to close the trap. After closure, enzymes are exuded to digest the prey. The process of two APs serves to protect the plant against accidental stimulation, but it remains an open question why the trap, having a kind of memory, only responds to the second AP."
- "plants distinguish between mechanical, insect, and pathogen-induced damage [58]"
 -->

<!-- ### Plant intelligence

Overall, the claim isn't that plants have some secret language that we weren't aware of. Instead, it's a reframing of ideas that are normally only attributable to animals or even just humans ("behavior," "intelligence"), in a way that might lead to a better understanding of plants and their evolution.

All the same, you can't help but feel that some authors are stretching it a bit, maybe for the sake of being provocative or entertaining...After all, it's way more fun to think of plants as intelligent (probably why the Ents are the best part of the LOTR books).
 -->

<!-- From "The Intelligent Behavior of Plants":
	"Definitions of ‘behavior’ and ‘intelli- gence’ vary. Intuitively we think of these terms as referring exclusively to humans, but essentially they describe the ability of organisms to respond to environmental challenges in such a way as to optimize fitness. Plants have simi- lar properties." -->

<!-- Or:
	"...led Anthony Trewavas to make a plea to consider plants as intelligent organisms exhibiting complex behavior to solve the problems of their sedentary lifestyle [12,13,32]. He advocates that the terms ‘intelligence’ and ‘behavior’ are appropriate because they essentially refer to decision making about alternative pathways to be chosen in order to survive, grow, and thrive." -->

<!-- From mescher2016:
	"Increasing appreciation of the fact that plants are highly attuned and responsive to their environments, as illus- trated by the examples above, has led some authors to argue that plants should be viewed as ‘intelligent’ organ- isms capable of making informed decisions and employ- ing complex behavior to solve problems posed by their environments [57 ,58]." -->

<!-- But:
	"plants probably construct corre- spondingly less information about their environments. This does not imply that plants are less well adapted to their environments than animals, only that the adaptation they exhibit may be somewhat less reliant on external informational inputs that mediate rapid responses to environmental variation." -->

<!-- Example of being a little overdramatic:
	"The Hidden Life of Trees: What They Feel, How They Communicate"
	- quote from Foreword: "The trees in a forest care for each other, sometimes even going so far as to nourish the stump of a felled tree for centuries after it was cut down by feeding it sugars and other nutrients, and so keeping it alove."
 -->
<!-- But there is still a use to calling it "intelligence"

- "species have been discussed at length as intelligent entities (Schull, 1990)" (he mentions the idea of "bacterial intelligence"
- "Different concepts and imaginative approaches are used in science because they suggest new experiments, new conceptual approaches and throw new light on complex problems."
- src: https://academic.oup.com/aob/article/93/4/353/197093
- but see: https://academic.oup.com/aob/article/93/4/345/197057
- by the way, Trewavas defines intelligence according to Stenhouse as "adaptive variable behaviour within the lifetime of an individual"
- The goal of plants is clearly not movement, as it is in animals; Stewavas suggests we should think through the "behavioural replacement of movement in animals by growth and development in plants"
	- "Intelligence controls fitness‐benefiting changes in behaviour: movement in animals, phenotypic plasticity in plants"
- "To investigate plant intelligence, cues should be taken from animal ethologists who 30–40 years ago faced the same limited proscription on the use of the word intelligence (humans only)." -->

### Well-behaved plants

So our working definition of intelligence is that which gives you "fitness‐benefiting changes in behaviour: movement in animals, phenotypic plasticity in plants." In other words, we can think of intelligent behavior as a [response to the environment that has some evolutionary benefit](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016953479901678X). Though they may appear motionless, plants definitely have some pretty impressive ways of adapting to their environment. A non-exhaustive list of things some plants can detect:

- [changes in daylength and temperature](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/154/2/516), allowing them to flower or germinate at the right time
- [gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitropism), so they can grow their stems up and their roots down
- [vibrations on leaves caused by chewing caterpillars](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00442-014-2995-6), causing the plants to emit a chemical that the caterpillars find unappealing
- [distributions of minerals in soil](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065250408602159), which can be thought of as a type of "foraging" behavior
- [the "smell" emitted by a damaged plant nearby](https://www.sciencemag.org/site/feature/misc/webfeat/plantvolatiles/), which some plants respond to by increasing their defenses

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/public/images/week6/fern2.png" style="width: 100%; min-width: 250px; float: left; margin-top: 20px; margin-right: 10px;">

### Can plants communicate?
<!-- ### If plants could talk -->

This last plant ability I listed, that of "smell," must have been the inspiration for [_The Happening_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0949731/), where plants learn to emit a chemical that kills nearby humans. But more importantly, this is also the entryway into the field of "plant communication."

The idea that plants could communicate got off to a bad start in 1983, when the first reports on ["talking trees"](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/bk-1983-0208.ch004) started appearing. The actual finding was that willow trees showed greater resistance to herbivores when they were nearby herbivore-infested willows than if they were further away. But the _interpretation_--that this meant trees were "communicating"--was not as solid. Since then, botanists have learned a bit more about the mechanism behind the effect, while also learning to speak in less provocative language.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/public/images/week6/vocs.png" style="width: 30%; min-width: 250px; float: left; margin-top: 20px; margin-right: 10px;">

It turns out that when certain plants are damaged (e.g., by a caterpillar chewing on its leaves, or when one of its stems is broken), that plant releases a so-called [volatile organic compound" (VOC)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534709003000) into the air. Other nearby plants can then detect these VOCs, and use these as cues to increase their own defenses, making them less likely to be attacked in the future.

But does this VOC signaling really qualify as plant "communication"? While this is an appealing conclusion (at least, I really wanted to believe it), there is one key problem with this sort of thinking: The benefits of VOC-signaling appear to only be for the plant _receiving_ the VOC. The emitting plant could actually be [endangering](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/294/5541/321) itself by releasing VOCs, because VOCs can attract parasitic plants or even more herbivores. Because "communication" is typically thought of as something beneficial to both parties, maybe we should think of this as "eavesdropping" rather than communication. In support of this interpretation is that the range of VOCs is very limited, and that VOCs have a stronger effect on more genetically-related individuals. This suggests that [VOCs may actually be used primarily for signaling _within_ a plant](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2009.01313.x), rather than signaling to others nearby.

### But what about my plant's feelings?

Just because plants don't have emotions or consciousness doesn't mean there isn't a definition of "intelligence" that might be useful scientifically. As Anthony Trewavas [put it](https://academic.oup.com/aob/article/93/4/353/197093): "Different concepts and imaginative approaches are used in science because they suggest new experiments, new conceptual approaches and throw new light on complex problems."

There are clearly a lot of behaviors plants have that you might not have expected. The problem is when the language we use to describe these behaviors start suggesting things that really aren't supported by the research itself. So when you read, for example, that [trees share resources through their roots](https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/50/330/9/456212), you might be tempted to conclude that ["the trees in a forest care for each other."](https://books.google.com/books?id=WEn4DAAAQBAJ&pg=PR8&lpg=PR8&dq=%22The+trees+in+a+forest+care+for+each+other,+sometimes+even+going+so+far+as%22&source=bl&ots=LZUZ9jrcLi&sig=UCP3uX9jRS6-TjS7JiUBIWqfixw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi035ujnLvbAhUptlkKHehADgMQ6AEIQDAE#v=onepage&q=%22The%20trees%20in%20a%20forest%20care%20for%20each%20other%2C%20sometimes%20even%20going%20so%20far%20as%22&f=false) But please...don't.

<!-- #### Plant communication by volatile signals (Heil, 2010)

- first report on "talking trees" was from 1983, where willows nearby other infested willows showed higher resistance than those further away
- signaling is via volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which can trigger defensive responses in nearby plants
- self-signaling is also via VOCs, so it could be that that's the origin of across-species communication
- however, the benefit is mostly for the receiving plant and not the emitting one, so the question is: what's the evolutionary origin of this? is there really a benefit for the emitter, or is this actually just "eavesdropping" on the within-organism communication
	- also, VOCs can attract parasitic plants or herbivores
	- also, communication is often very short-range, and not always within the range of neighbors in the wild...but for sagebrush it is within range of neighbors...but unclear still
- most studies have been done in an ecological context, and so the underlying molecular mechanisms are still unknown
- great list on instances of VOC communication among plants

possible explanations of why emitters should release VOCs:
1. VOCs are a by-product of the emitter's defense mechanism itself; other plants have just learned to detect this cue
2. VOCs are used for within-plant signaling; this is faster than vascular signaling, and not anatomy-specific
3. kin selection; under group selection theory, VOC signaling would be beneficial to the plant population

Two ways of communicating:

- vasculature (trees)
- volatile (_The Happening_) -->

<!-- #### Plant recognition of self (Karban, 2009)

- animals can recognize self; can plants? experiment here is to clip leaves on one plant and see whether nearby plants show less future damage, due to the volatile communication from clipping being used as a signal
	- they find that communication is more effective among genetically identical plants than for non-identical ones
- conclusion: plants likely have volatile (i.e., via air, not roots) communication with neighbors, but it is more effective if it is with genetically identical organisms
	- could be a by-product of _within_-species communication also being volatile
	- the risk of volatile communication is eaves-dropping -->

<!-- Functions:

- "As a consequence, a plant could reduce the number of herbivores by more than 90% by releasing volatiles." [src](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/291/5511/2141) in _Nicotiana attenuata_
- "The production of plant volatiles elicits responses from natural enemies of herbivores in two ways. Predators and parasitoids are innately attracted to some plant volatiles and learn to associate other volatiles with the presence of prey (28, 29)." [src](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/294/5541/321) -->

<!-- Ways plants sense:

- "light" (allows detection of seasons, or of neighboring plants)
- "smell" (VOCs)
	- "olfactory cues deriving from nearby damaged plant tissues [51  ] or the herbivores themselves [52 ]"
	- also (and originally) found with willows: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00442-013-2610-2
- "taste" nutrients in dirt and adjust types of root growth accordingly
	- "biochemical elicitors in the oral secretions of feeding herbivores [48] or on the surface of herbivore eggs"
- "feel" force (gravity) and wind
	- "The plants also discriminated between the vibrations caused by chewing and those caused by wind or insect song." -> better defense when exposed to vibrations from caterpillar chewing on leaves
	- src: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00442-014-2995-6
- "effects of temperature and light (including day length) on the timing of developmental processes such as germination and flowering" [mescher2016] -->

<!-- Learning in plants:

- habituation to repeated irritation in mimosa
- flowering requires a certain stimulus (e.g., a freeze), then the plant "remembers" it in order to be able to flower at the right time
- priming to be better defended against repeated attacks

Plants as social communities composed of cells:
	"Thus, one could consider the individual plant cell as a unit that is equivalent to an entire higher organism. Any green plant cell is fully able to take up air, absorb light quanta, and retrieve water from xylem vessels, and to deliver products of photosynthesis and signaling compounds to the phloem. The cell reacts locally to incoming signals from within and outside the plant."

Something about Jainism? -->

<!-- ### Plant information (Karban, 1999)

- behavioral "plasticity" is when one genotype can lead to multiple phenotypes depending on the environment
	- e.g., wild tobacco can respond to herbivory and up its defense against predators
- if plants are to use information to change phenotype, this is only useful if information now is informative about information in the future
	- e.g., if herbivory levels now are correlated with future herbivory (or even the opposite, e.g., with migratory species), plants could use early herbivory to up their defenses -->

### Summary

- _Topic_: Plant intelligence and communication
- _Why we care_: Plants are the basis of most ecosystems, but the degree to which they modify their behavior in response to their surroundings is not well understood
- _Conclusion_: Describing plant behavior using human-centric words like "intelligence" walks a fine line between inspiring new research and becoming scientific click-bait
