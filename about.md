Hi! This is Jay. I want to read more about things I'm utterly clueless about, so I figured 2018 was a good time to start.

Each week, I will start out by picking a random topic, like "bridges," "trees," or maybe even "fMRI." Then I will find a recent/influential scientific paper published on that topic, give it a read, and summarize what I learned. My goal is to write something that you can read or skim in about five to ten minutes.

If you have a topic you'd like to request, send me an email at <img src="{{ site.url }}/public/images/email.png" alt="email address" style="width: 25%;">

Thanks for reading!
