Hi! This is Jay. I want to learn more about basically anything, so I figured 2018 was a good time to start.

Each week, I will start out by picking a random topic, like "bridges," "trees," or whatever else comes to mind. Then I will find a recent/influential scientific paper published on that topic, give it a read, and summarize what I learned. My goal is to write something that you can read or skim in about five to ten minutes.

If you have a topic you'd like to request, send me a message <a href="https://twitter.com/jehosafet">here</a>.

Thanks for reading!
